You are given a two lists  A and B . Your task is to compute their cartesian product AXB.
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
from itertools import product
A=[int(x) for x in input().split()]
B=[int(x) for x in input().split()]
l=[]
l.append(A)
l.append(B)
m=list(product(*l))
for i in range(0,len(m)):
    print(m[i],end=' ')
